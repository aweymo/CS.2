The text mining process involved retrieving the top 40 items of each group based on relevance, or the greatest number of matches for each search term. The searches all followed the same formula, "_____ labor," 1880-1930 date range, and Washington or Oregon state based publications. From these forty items, results were filtered down to 10 items based on their locality.

Items that were reprints of stories outside of Washington and Oregon were removed. Documents generally focused on events within this area, but editorials on some national topics could be included if they provided insight into Pacific Northwest culture. These ten items were then separated into five earlier and later halves, demonstrating linguistic change over time.

Certain words used in the search were then removed from results. For example, in "Japanese labor," "Japanese," "labor," "laborer" and any words referring to that community group would be removed from visualizations, including slurs. This was not done to sanitize the material, rather to focus on the underlying industrial and economic elements that may have been influencing this media.

These corpuses were then processed through Voyant, an open-source, web-based application for performing text analysis. The visualization that you see are the number of times particular words are repeated within the corpus, demonstrated by the size of each word's bubble. Hover over the bubble for the exact number and drag the bubbles around if you have trouble reading anything depending on how the visualization loads. 

This method is still developing and being improved upon. This data and the overall project serves as a proof of concept towards future research.
