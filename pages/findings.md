The selected texts were processed through Voyant, an open-source, web-based application for performing text analysis. The visualization that you see are the number of times particular words are repeated within the corpus, demonstrated by the size of each word's bubble. Hover over the bubble for the exact number and drag the bubbles around if you have trouble reading anything depending on how the visualization loads. To learn more about the methodology behind the selection of texts and the preperation of these materials, plase visit the Methodology section in Home.

This method is still developing and being improved upon. This data and the overall project serves as a proof of concept towards future research.
